This project presents an end-to-end sales analysis for FOGG, covering the full financial year FY24 (April 2023 – March 2024).
The goal of this analysis is to understand how the brand performed across revenue, units sold, pricing, and product category contribution, while identifying trends, gaps, and strategic opportunities.

This project demonstrates strong capabilities in data modeling, DAX calculations, data visualization, business interpretation, 
and the development of an MIS-style performance dashboard tailored for a consumer goods brand.
